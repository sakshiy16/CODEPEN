## Project Overview

**CodePen** replicates the core functionality of CodePen, providing three code editors (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) with syntax highlighting and a live preview pane. This project demonstrates:

- Integration of CodeMirror in React.
- State management for editor content.
- Dynamic generation of an iframe `srcDoc` for live rendering.
- Responsive, collapsible editor panes.
- Use of React hooks, component composition, and CSS for layout.

It serves as a learning exercise and as a showcase piece for front-end/interview portfolios.

## Technologies Used

- **React** â€“ Frontend library for building UI components.
- **CodeMirror** + **react-codemirror2** â€“ Integrated code editor with syntax highlighting.
- **FontAwesome** â€“ Icons for toggle buttons.
- **HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6+)** â€“ Core web technologies.
- **Flexbox / CSS Grid** â€“ Responsive layout for editor and preview panes.
- **Netlify** â€“ Deployment of the static React app.

## Features

- **Three separate editors** for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with syntax highlighting.
- **Live preview** pane that updates in real-time as you type (debounced for performance).
- **Collapsible editor panes**: focus on a particular language by expanding or collapsing panels.
- **Responsive design**: adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Sandboxed iframe** for rendering user code safely (`sandbox="allow-scripts"`).
- **Clean, minimal UI** resembling CodePenâ€™s core experience.
