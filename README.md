## Project Overview

**CodePen** replicates the core functionality of CodePen, providing three code editors (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) with syntax highlighting and a live preview pane. This project demonstrates:

- Integration of CodeMirror in React.
- State management for editor content.
- Dynamic generation of an iframe `srcDoc` for live rendering.
- Responsive, collapsible editor panes.
- Use of React hooks, component composition, and CSS for layout.

It serves as a learning exercise and as a showcase piece for front-end/interview portfolios.
